## Background

A research study aims to identify key factors that predict the severity of COVID-19 illness. This study collects demographic information, clinical variables, and disease severity among participants infected with COVID-19 between 2021 and 2023. The goal is to develop a robust prediction model that can accurately predict COVID-19 severity and understand how predictors impact the risk of severe infection.
